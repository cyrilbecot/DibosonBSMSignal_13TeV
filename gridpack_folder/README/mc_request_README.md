1)
 When you are done with the generation of gridpacks, please inform Eiko. 
Eiko will copy all your gridpacks to

/store/group/phys_generator/cvmfs/gridpacks/slc6_amd64_gcc481/13TeV/madgraph/V5_2.2.2//exo_diboson/ 

In a few hours, these gridpacks will appear at 

/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/phys_generator/gridpacks/slc6_amd64_gcc481/13TeV/madgraph/V5_2.2.2//exo_diboson/

2)
While waiting for the copying of gridpacks, you could start preparing the google spreadsheet.
An empty spreadsheet is here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=1ScU2IXtgAXSm-vjXBKTGVAzo3j7wcLehwuGawQ35h-0&newcopy

An example spreadsheet is here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MQ0lAfQmHLT6edGBp_seGc1xvWoZ5hgSiHjO27TOmDg/edit#gid=0

Note, you need to enter the github link of your input cards.

[If you don't know which one is the latest branch of your decay mode,
go to https://github.com/cms-sw/genproductions/tree/master/bin/MadGraph5_aMCatNLO/cards/production/13TeV/exo_diboson,
go to the subfolder of your decay mode, click on "latest commit". The numbers and letters after
"https://github.com/cms-sw/genproductions/commit/" in the url address is the corresponding latest branch.]

 You could find out more information about each column of the google spreadsheet here:

3)

  Once you are done with the google spreadsheet, you need to include EXO MC contacts as one of the editors for 
 most of the Exo VV channels and the di-higgs channels with mass above 1 TeV (including 1 TeV)

 Exo MC:
```
 David Nash <dnash@cern.ch>, 
 David Sheffield <david.g.sheffield@gmail.com>,
 Oscar Gonzalez Lopez <oglez@mail.cern.ch>
```

 For the di-higgs channels with mass below 1 TeV, include Higgs MC contacts as the editor:

 Higgs MC:

```
 Olivier Bondu <Olivier.Bondu@cern.ch>
 Pietro Govoni <pietro.govoni@cern.ch>
 Chayanit Asawatangtrakuldee <Chayanit.Asawatangtrakuldee@cern.ch>
 Prafulla Behera <prafulla.behera@cern.ch>
```

4) Send emails to these contacts and include the following people in cc.
 Note, in the email you need to add link to your google spreadsheet.

```
 Shin-Shan Yu <syu@cern.ch>
 Alexandra Carvalho <alexandracaan@gmail.com>
 Andreas Hinzmann <andreas.hinzmann@cern.ch>
 Clemens Lange <clange@physik.uzh.ch>
 Thiago Tomei <thiago.tomei@cern.ch>
```
